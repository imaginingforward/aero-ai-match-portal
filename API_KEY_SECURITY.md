# API Key Security Update

## Overview

This document details the security improvements made to remove hardcoded API keys from the frontend code. These changes ensure that sensitive keys like the OpenAI API key and Baserow API token are no longer exposed in the frontend codebase.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed hardcoded API keys from frontend code**
   - Removed OpenAI API key from `src/utils/envConfig.ts`
   - Removed Baserow API token from `src/services/baserowService.ts`

2. **Updated frontend services to use backend proxies**
   - Modified `src/services/matchingService.ts` to call backend API endpoints
   - Modified `src/services/baserowService.ts` to call backend API endpoints 
   - Updated environment configuration to use Vite environment variables

3. **Added environment variable configuration**
   - Created `.env.example` as a template for frontend environment variables

## Implementation Details

### Backend Proxy Architecture

The application now uses a more secure architecture where:

1. Frontend makes requests to backend API endpoints
2. Backend contains all sensitive API keys in its own `.env` file
3. Backend makes authenticated requests to external services (OpenAI, Baserow)

This ensures that API keys are never exposed to the client.

### Environment Variables

Frontend environment variables are now managed through Vite's built-in environment variable system:

```
# Example frontend variables (.env.development.local)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3002
VITE_AI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-nano
```

Backend environment variables remain in the `sam-api-service/.env` file:

```
# Backend variables (sam-api-service/.env)
PORT=3002
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-*****
BASEROW_API_TOKEN=*****
# ...other variables...
```

## Fallback Mechanism

For development and testing purposes, the frontend maintains a fallback to local demo data when:
- The backend API is not available
- API calls fail for any reason

## Setup Instructions

1. **Backend Setup**:
   - Ensure the backend environment variables are properly set in `sam-api-service/.env`
   - Make sure the backend server is running on the expected port

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.development.local` 
   - Configure the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to point to your backend server
   - Start the frontend development server

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit `.env` files or API keys to version control
- Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Keep API keys and secrets server-side only
- Use proxy endpoints for any API that requires authentication
